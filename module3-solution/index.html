						Long ago, a drop of liquid sunlight sprouted a magical healing flower. For centuries, Mother Gothel used the flower to retain her youth, until soldiers from a nearby kingdom plucked it to heal their ailing and pregnant queen. Shortly afterward, the Queen gives birth to Princess Rapunzel, whose golden hair contains the flower's healing properties. Gothel tries to steal a lock of Rapunzel's hair to use the power once again but discovers that cutting the hair renders it inert. She instead abducts Rapunzel and raises her as her own in a secret tower. In order to keep the confined, isolated Rapunzel content, Gothel teaches her to fear the outside world and its people. Each year, the King and Queen release sky lanterns on Rapunzel's birthday, hoping for their daughter to see them and return.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the eve of her 18th birthday, Rapunzel asks to leave the tower and discover the lanterns' source, but Gothel refuses. Meanwhile in the kingdom, a thief named Flynn Rider steals Rapunzel's intended crown from the palace and ditches his partners, the Stabbington brothers, while fleeing. He takes refuge with the crown in Rapunzel's tower, but Rapunzel knocks him unconscious and hides him in the closet. Gothel returns, and Rapunzel tries to show Flynn to her to demonstrate her readiness for the "dangerous" outside world. However, Gothel still dismisses her.
					</p>
					<p>
						Rapunzel sends Gothel away on a three-day journey to acquire paints. With Gothel gone, Rapunzel hides the crown from Flynn and leverages it to convince him to escort her to see the lanterns for her birthday. Along the way, Flynn brings Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling, a pub filled with menacing thugs, who initially try to capture the wanted Flynn but instead, are charmed by Rapunzel. Meanwhile, Gothel comes upon Maximus, a palace horse determined to capture Flynn. Recognizing that kingdom guards may be closing in on her hidden tower, she returns to check on Rapunzel. She discovers her gone and Flynn's satchel with stolen crown there instead and goes after the pair.
					</p>
					<h3 id="beef" class="text-center">Beef</h3>
					<p>
						Royal soldiers led by Maximus arrive at the pub in search of Flynn. Rapunzel and Flynn escape but are trapped in a flooding cave. Resigned to their fate, Flynn reveals his real name, Eugene Fitzherbert, and Rapunzel reveals that her hair glows when she sings. They use the light to escape the cave and take refuge in the forest. That night, Gothel, now in league with the Stabbingtons, gives the crown to Rapunzel and suggests using it to test Eugene's loyalty.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the morning, Maximus finds the pair and tries to arrest Flynn, but Rapunzel demands a truce in honor of her birthday. The group reach the kingdom and enjoy the birthday festivities, culminating in an evening cruise as the lanterns are released. There, Rapunzel gives Eugene the crown after fulfilling her dream of seeing the lanterns in person. They confess their love and are about to kiss when Eugene notices the Stabbingtons on the shore. He leaves Rapunzel to give them the crown as an apology, but they assault him and tie him to a boat headed for the palace. Eugene is detained while the brothers convince Rapunzel that Eugene has abandoned her. Gothel stages a rescue and returns with Rapunzel to the tower.
					</p>
					<p>
						There, Rapunzel suddenly recognizes the symbol of the kingdom, which she had subconsciously incorporated into her paintings over the years. Realizing that she is the long-lost princess for whom the lanterns are sent, she confronts Gothel. At the same time, Maximus and the Duckling thugs help Eugene escape captivity, and Maximus rushes him back to Gothel's tower. Eugene enters by climbing Rapunzel's hair, only to find Rapunzel chained and gagged. Gothel stabs Eugene and tries to flee with Rapunzel. Rapunzel agrees to go willingly if she is allowed to heal Eugene first. Wanting her to be free, Eugene cuts off her hair, which turns brown and loses its magic, causing Gothel to age rapidly and fall to her death.
					</p>
					<p>
						Rapunzel mourns for Eugene, heartbroken, and one of her tears, still containing the flower's magic, lands on his cheek and restores his life. The two return to the kingdom where Rapunzel reunites with her royal, real parents. And finally, after a time, marries Eugene.

						A wealthy widower has a beautiful young daughter; a girl of unparalleled kindness and sweet temper. The gentleman marries a proud and haughty woman as his second wife. She has two daughters, who are equally vain and selfish. The girl is forced into servitude by her stepmother, where she is made to work day and night doing menial chores. After the girl's chores are done for the day, she curls up near the fireplace in an effort to stay warm. She often arises covered in cinders, giving rise to the mocking nickname "Cinderella" by her stepsisters. Cinderella bears the abuse patiently and does not tell her father, who would have scolded her.
					</p>
					<p>
						One day, the prince invites all the young ladies in the land to a royal ball, planning to choose a wife. The two stepsisters gleefully plan their wardrobes for the ball, and taunt Cinderella by telling her that maids are not invited to the ball.
						As the sisters depart to the ball, Cinderella cries in despair. Her Fairy Godmother magically appears and immediately begins to transform Cinderella from house servant to the young lady she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to the ball. She turns a pumpkin into a golden carriage, mice into horses, a rat into a coachman, and lizards into footmen. She then turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful jeweled gown, complete with a delicate pair of glass slippers. The Godmother tells her to enjoy the ball, but warns her that she must return before midnight, when the spells will be broken.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the ball, the entire court is entranced by Cinderella, especially the Prince. At this first ball, Cinderella remembers to leave before midnight. Back home, Cinderella graciously thanks her Godmother. She then innocently greets the stepsisters, who had not recognized her earlier, and talk of nothing but the beautiful girl at the ball.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another ball is held the next evening, and Cinderella again attends with her Godmother's help. The prince has become even more infatuated with the mysterious woman at the ball, and Cinderella in turn becomes so enchanted by him she loses track of time and leaves only at the final stroke of midnight, losing one of her glass slippers on the steps of the palace in her haste. The Prince chases her, but outside the palace, the guards see only a simple country girl leave. The prince pockets the slipper and vows to find and marry the girl to whom it belongs. Meanwhile, Cinderella keeps the other slipper, which does not disappear when the spell is broken.
					</p>
					<p>
						The prince tries the slipper on all the women in the kingdom. When the prince arrives at Cinderella's home, the stepsisters try in vain to win him over. Cinderella asks if she may try, but the stepsisters taunt her. Naturally, the slipper fits perfectly, and Cinderella produces the other slipper for good measure. Cinderella's stepfamily pleads for forgiveness, and Cinderella agrees. Cinderella had hoped her step-family would love her always.
